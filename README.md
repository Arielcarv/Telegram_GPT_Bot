# Telegram_GPT_Bot
A telegram bot connected with chat GPT. It responds questions and stuff. :D 

# How to use

1. Call the [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on telegram and send a `/start`. [BotFather Doc](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather)
2. Ask him to create a `/newbot`. The BotFather will help you with the process.
3. Name your bot.
4. Choose a username for the bot. (Yeah, it has to be a unique and end with "bot")
5. After that the BotFather gives you the `BOT_API_TOKEN` to use in the code.


# Deploy

You can deploy your bot server on [Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/Arielcarv/) as I did. It's free!
